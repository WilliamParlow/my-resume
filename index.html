                        Hello! My name is William Parlow. I live in Jaraguá do
                        Sul located on state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. You

                        I have worked with different people, with different
                        cultures and distinct ways of thinking, which made me a
                        good listener and a good negotiator, raising gains for
                        the client and the development team. In this journey, I
                        learn a lot of programming concepts and different
                        programming paradigms, making me a flexible developer. I
                        had contact with a lot of languages like Java, C/C++,
                        C#, PHP, Python Kotlin and Javascript with HTML5 as
                        markup language and CSS3 for styling. As programming
                        tools and frameworks, I worked with Node.js, Serverless
                        with google cloud (Firebase), Git, Ionic, Angular, React
                        and React Native integrated with Redux. I'm always
                        seeking good programming practices, learning with my
                        mistakes and making better codes through lessons
                        learned. I'm Fluent on Brazilian Portuguese,
                        intermediary level in English, and a very little
                        knowledge of German.
